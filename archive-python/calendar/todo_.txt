Things that can possibly be added
-A instructions.html page from the menu which just explains everything
-A configuration menu which would let:
	-choose language:english/swedish
	-choose notification emails etc
-Reminding someone to go select lunches when there is nothing selected x time before (1 day for example)
-I would place the machine estimations in another color, so that the resident knows that he didn't write anything himself.
-I would keep the residents meal history in case it is useful in the future. As well for statistics, etc
-I would implement a password recovery mechanism.

//Of course many other things apart from these have to be implemented before. This is just a bunch of ideas.
